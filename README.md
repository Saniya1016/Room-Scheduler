# Team 13 Project

The application name  BuildingManager

The first section titled Team Overview includes the names of each team member and their GitHub usernames: Aadit Bhatia, Saniya Sekhon, Ananya Srivastava, Will Wallace

Innovative Idea : Ours is a workforce management app. A company can schedule employee shifts and maintain details of all its available assets(meeting rooms, cafeterias etc.). Furthermore, we will have a calendar component where the user can schedule all their events. Also, we will have a feature which can assign meeting rooms in a building to different people. 
There are workforce management apps, like workday, oracle, dayforce etc. but ours is different because we have more features like event schedulers

List of the data your application will support. For each data type, you must include a brief description of the data and how it will be used in your application:
Worker- Shift hours(time), Wage, Position(manager, front-desk staff, etc)
Calendar - Worker hours, meeting rooms, event rooms
Event Room- contain a capacity, chairs, and availibility
Meeting rooms- contain a capacity, chairs, and availibility

The fourth section titled Functionality provides a list of the functionality your application will support. For each functionality, you must include a brief description of the functionality and how it will be used in your application. For example, if you are creating a recipe application, you might have a functionality for adding a recipe. You would then describe how a user would add a recipe to your application. You must include at least four different types of functionality.
