Innovative Idea : Ours is a workforce management app. A company can schedule employee shifts and maintain details of all its available assets(meeting rooms, cafeterias etc.). Furthermore, we will have a calendar component where the user can schedule all their events. Also, we will have a feature which can assign meeting rooms in a building to different people. 
There are workforce management apps, like workday, oracle, dayforce etc. but ours is different because we have more features like event schedulers

The fourth section titled Functionality provides a list of the functionality your application will support.
